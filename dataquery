-- Original table with repeating groups.
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    ProductNames VARCHAR(MAX) -- Comma-separated list of products.
);

-- Normalize the table into 1NF by splitting repeating groups.
CREATE TABLE Orders_1NF (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    ProductName VARCHAR(100)
);
Explanation:

Purpose of the Query :
The goal is to eliminate repeating groups and ensure atomic values in each column, achieving 1NF.
Key Components :
Orders_1NF: A normalized table where each product is stored in a separate row.
Each column contains only one value per row.
Why use 1NF? :
1NF ensures that data is stored in a structured format, making it easier to query and maintain.
It eliminates redundancy caused by repeating groups.
Real-World Application :
In an e-commerce system, storing each product in a separate row simplifies order processing.
Notes:

Repeating groups violate 1NF and can lead to data anomalies.
Ensure that all columns contain atomic values after normalization.
Important Considerations:
Splitting tables may increase the number of rows but improves data integrity.
